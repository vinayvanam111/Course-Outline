<h1 id="Web-Evolution"><u>Web Evolution & How it Works? </u></h1>

<p>The web today is a growing universe of interlinked web pages and web apps, teeming with videos, photos and interactive content. What the average user doesn't see is the interplay of web technologies and browsers that makes all this possible.

    Over time, web technologies have evolved to give web developers the ability to create new generations of useful and immersive web experiences. Today's web is a result of the ongoing efforts of an open web community that helps define these web technologies, like HTML5, CSS3 and WebGL, and ensure that they're supported in all web browsers.

    The colour bands in this visualisation represent the interaction between web technologies and browsers, which brings to life the many powerful web apps that we use daily.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web is the universe of network-accessible information, an embodiment of human knowledge.

    In simple terms, The World Wide Web is a way of exchanging information between computers on the Internet, tying them together into a vast collection of interactive multimedia resources.</p>



<p>Web technology has come a long way since its introduction during the 1980s. There was a time when the World Wide Web was used primarily by researchers of universities to share information related to their academic work with specific audience (co-workers).  Times have changed greatly and today social media sites like Facebook and Google search engine have become a part of daily life even for a layman living in third world nations. The developments responsible for this change within the web technology landscape are spread across different fields. It has to do with advancements in mark-up languages, programming languages, server technology, data transmission technology and infrastructure that supports internet. The write-up tries to explore few key areas of in the course of evolution of web technologies.</p>

<p>The birth of HTML can roughly be marked with the birth of World Wide Web. Tim Berners-Lee, who is responsible for the introduction of World Wide Web, wrote the software for this browser and a server by 1990. The browser was developed to be able to interpret and compose content (just text) and display it on the web page. Tags were used on the back-end of web pages which were processed by the browser and content displayed in the computer. Development of HTML tags took place stage-by-stage, initially from displaying simple text to be able to display pictures and add better visual effects during the late 1990s period. The development of new tags was closely related to introduction of browsers that could interpret and display content in a better way. Netscape was one of the browsers back then which had these abilities. The developers further went on to standardize markup language such that all browsers could interpret website in a similar way. Earlier browser specific tags were the standard for web pages. Today, HTML is continued to be used as one of the markup languages for designing websites both static and dynamic.</p>

<h1 id="Web-Standards"><u>Web Standards, Website & Web page:</u></h1>

<p>Web standards are rules and guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) developed to promote consistency in the design code which makes up a web page. Without getting technical, simply it's the guideline for the mark-up language which determines how a web page.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Web pages will display in a wide variety of browsers and computers, including new technology like iPhones, Droids, iPads, PDA devices, mobile phones, which greatly increases the viewing audience.</li>
    <li>W3C Standards promote the use of "Cascading Style Sheets" (CSS) or design code which is attached to the web page. rather than embedded in the page. The use of style sheets significantly reduces the page file size which means not only a faster page loading time but lower hosting costs for frequently visited sites due to using less bandwidth.</li>
    <li>Design features such as colors and fonts can be easily changed by just modifying one style sheet instead of editing every individual page in a web site, reducing the costs to modify your site.</li>
    <li>Search Engines are able to access and index pages designed to web standards with greater efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<p>A website[1] is a collection of related web pages, including multimedia content, typically identified with a common domain name, and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com. Today roughly 380 new websites are created every minute across the World.[2]

    A website may be accessible via a public Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet, or a private local area network (LAN), by referencing a uniform resource locator (URL) that identifies the site.

    Websites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a personal website, a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment and social networking to providing news and education. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically a part of an intranet.</p>

<p>A web page (also written as webpage) is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and web browsers. A web browser displays a web page on a monitor or mobile device.

    The web page usually means what is visible, but the term may also refer to a computer file, usually written in HTML or a comparable markup language. Web browsers coordinate various web resource elements for the written web page, such as style sheets, scripts, and images, to present the web page. Typical web pages provide hypertext that includes a navigation bar or a sidebar menu linking to other web pages via hyperlinks, often referred to as links.</p>


<h1 id="Protocols"><u>Protocols, Domain Name & Hosting, Editors (Developer Tools/IDE’s)</u></h1>

<p>In information technology, a protocol is the special set of rules that end points in a telecommunication connection use when they communicate. Protocols specify interactions between the communicating entities. </p>
<p>The virtualized network poses challenges to network management systems -- and as more hardware components become virtualized, that challenge becomes even greater. This handbook discusses the steps IT must take to both build and corral their virtualized infrastructure. Protocols exist at several levels in a telecommunication connection. For example, there are protocols for the data interchange at the hardware device level and protocols for data interchange at the application program level. In the standard model known as Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), there are one or more protocols at each layer in the telecommunication exchange that both ends of the exchange must recognize and observe. Protocols are often described in an industry or international standard.</p>
<p>A domain name is your website name. A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.

    A domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, and it can be used in combination of the various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more.

    The domain name must be registered before you can use it. Every domain name is unique. No two websites can have the same domain name. If someone types in www.yourdomain.com, it will go to your website and no one else's.</p>
<p>An editor is the person who is in charge of a newspaper or magazine and who decides what will be published in each edition of it.</p>

<h3>Editors</h3>

</ul>


<h1 id="Browser-console"><u>Browser console tools:</u></h1>
<p>The Browser Console is like the Web Console, but applied to the whole browser rather than a single content tab.

    So it logs the same sorts of information as the Web Console - network requests, JavaScript, CSS, and security errors and warnings, and messages explicitly logged by JavaScript code. However, rather than logging this information for a single content tab, it logs information for all content tabs, for add-ons, and for the browser's own code.

    If you also want to use the other web developer tools in the regular Web Toolbox with add-on or browser code, consider using the Browser Toolbox.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can execute JavaScript expressions using the Browser Console. But while the Web Console executes code in the page window scope, the Browser Console executes them in the scope of the browser's chrome window. This means you can interact with all the browser's tabs using the gBrowser global, and even with the XUL used to specify the browser's user interface. The Browser Console is like the Web Console, but applied to the whole browser rather than a single content tab. So it logs the same sorts of information as the Web Console - network requests, JavaScript, CSS, and security errors and warnings, and messages explicitly logged by JavaScript code.</p>
